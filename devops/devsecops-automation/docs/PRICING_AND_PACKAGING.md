## What Affects Pricing?

### Self-Service SaaS Pricing Factors

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Number of Assets:** More assets = higher tier or overage charges
2. **Scan Frequency:** More scans = higher tier or overage charges
3. **Users:** More users = higher tier or overage charges
4. **Data Retention:** Longer retention = higher tier
5. **Support Level:** Better support = higher tier

**Does NOT Affect Pricing:**
- Industry (manufacturing, healthcare, etc.)
- Geography (US, international)
- Compliance requirements (included in Enterprise)
- Data volume (within storage limits)

---

### Managed SOC Pricing Factors

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Number of Assets:** Base package + overage charges
2. **Number of Sites:** Base package + extra site charges
3. **Coverage Hours:** 8x5 vs. 24x7 (huge price difference)
4. **Environment Complexity:** IT-only vs. IT+OT (+30%)
5. **Compliance Requirements:** NERC CIP, IEC 62443 (+20-40%)
6. **Risk Profile:** Critical infrastructure, high-risk (+30-50%)

**Does NOT Affect Pricing:**
- Industry (manufacturing, utilities, etc.) - only complexity matters
- Geography (US, international) - same pricing
- Alert volume (we filter false positives)
- Incident frequency (included in service)

**Example: Two Customers, Same 100 Assets**

**Customer A: IT-Only, No Compliance**
```
Base price (100 assets, 24x7):    $15,000/month
IT-only (no premium):              $0
No compliance (no premium):        $0
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                            $15,000/month
```

**Customer B: IT+OT, NERC CIP, Critical Infrastructure**
```
Base price (100 assets, 24x7):    $15,000/month
IT + OT environment (+30%):        $4,500/month
NERC CIP compliance (+40%):        $7,800/month
Critical infrastructure (+50%):    $13,650/month
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                            $40,950/month
```

**Why such a big difference?**
- Customer B requires specialized OT/ICS expertise
- NERC CIP has extensive reporting requirements
- Critical infrastructure has higher risk and responsibility
- More complex environment requires more SOC analyst time

## ROI Analysis

### Typical ROI for Managed SOC Customers

**Cost of Service (Enterprise Tier):**
- Annual cost: $180,000/year

**Value Delivered:**
- Prevented ransomware attack: **$1,500,000** (avg. cost per IBM 2023 study)
- Prevented data breach: **$500,000** (avg. cost for mid-sized org)
- Compliance penalty avoidance: **$250,000** (NERC CIP violation)
- Downtime avoidance: **$100,000** (1 day production downtime)
- Staff time savings: **$100,000** (no need to hire 2 analysts)

**Total Value:** $2,450,000/year

**ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (Value - Cost) / Cost × 100%
ROI = ($2,450,000 - $180,000) / $180,000 × 100%
ROI = 1,261%
```

**Payback Period:** Less than 1 month (if major incident prevented)

**Conservative ROI (No Major Incidents):**
```
Staff time savings:               $100,000/year
Compliance support:               $50,000/year
Audit readiness:                  $25,000/year
────────────────────────────────────────────
Total value:                      $175,000/year

ROI = ($175,000 - $180,000) / $180,000 × 100%
ROI = -3% (slight loss)

BUT: Peace of mind, risk reduction, compliance assurance = priceless
```

**Bottom Line:** Managed SOC pays for itself if it prevents even one major incident.
